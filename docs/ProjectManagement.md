    Retrospective : In this sprint, we created a credits page, a login page, a register page

    Retrospective : In this sprint, we improved the favorite movies page and we added some movies that when

    Retrospective : In this sprint, besides upgrading the features implemented on the other sprints we added
    the option for a user to leave a review on a movie and do some actions over that review (delete, edit,...).

Release:
<a href="https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC10T5/releases/tag/v4.0"> MovieMetric v4.0 </a>

    Retrospective : In this sprint, we added the movies to a real time database using Firebase so that the
    user can save his favorite movies without worrying about them disappearing. We also implemented more unit
    tests and gherkin automated tests. Altough implemented the tests could be slightly improved with more time,
    plus we didn't get the time to do more new user stories since the last sprint since we were perfecting the ones
    that were 'done' so they could be 'done done done'!
